The Mo'mega (Mo' Omega)  Pickaxe Source Code Repository - Forge MC Mod
Current Work In Progress - GIT Source to be released March - Early April 2021

ABOUT:
Mo'mega (Mo' Omega) is a higher tier pickaxe the equivalent of a netherite pick axe. 
Specifically designed for ores found in mods such as AlltheMods (Allthemodium, unobtanium) etc
Mo'mega will be an all round pickaxe for the harder to mine ores at the sacrifice of speed.
Speed can be adjusted with enchants but base pick will be slower to create balance between easier build recipe and with the ability to mine harder to obtain ores.
